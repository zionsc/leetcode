The diameter of a tree is the number of edges in the longest path in that tree.

There is an undirected tree of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D array edges where edges.length == n - 1 and edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.

Return the diameter of the tree.
